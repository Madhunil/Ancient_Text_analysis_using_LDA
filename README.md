# Indo-European language family analysis using NLP techniques

This project aims on discovering insights between ancient Indo-European languages by applying NLP techniques to the early Indo-European classics. For this I developed python-based web-scraping tools to extract and structure text corpora from ancient Indo-European text data

The aim is to discover the order in which these languages evolved, and eventually analyzing and reconstructing the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) language using the power of generative AI
